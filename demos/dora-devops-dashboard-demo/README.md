**DORA x DevOps - Demo (GitHub Pages)**

Overview
A fully browser-based simulator that translates DevOps practices into indicators of DORA compliance.  
Adjust the parameters (multi-region configuration, immutable backups, quarterly chaos testing, monitoring coverage, SBOM and artefact signing, CFR, MTTR, RTO/RPO, and third-party concentration) and observe both pillar-specific and overall scores.

Deployment  
1) Upload these files to a repository (main branch).
2) Go to *Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → main / root.*
3) Open the resulting GitHub Pages URL.

Usage  
1) Move the sliders or load one of the preset configurations.  
2) Review the radar chart and the “Global” bar to interpret overall performance.  
3) Export a JSON file containing the selected parameters and computed scores.

Note  
This is a pedagogical model. It does not replace a formal compliance assessment but helps align operational practices with the resilience objectives defined under DORA.
